    "In the example above, you see multiple different types of columns: the `index` column, for example, is an increasing number without a decimal place. We can also see the datetime columns, as well as numbers with decimal places and text, such as `Non-Validated`. In Python, each of these has their own data type. The aforementioned data types like numbers with and without a decimal place, datetime and text, are in [Python all built-in and can be used right away](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#built-in-types). The data type tells Python how to save the data, as well as what can be done to the data. For example, we can round float values (numbers with decimal places) to another decimal place, but this doesn't make sense for text data, so called strings. Similarly, we can make an entire string lowercase, but this doesn't make sense for float value data. \n",

Later on, you will look at additional data types that come in when you use different Python **[libraries](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/libraries-in-python/)**. Libraries are like extension packages in video games: they add additional functionalities to Python, including different data types and ways of handling the data."
