Pandas is a [package](https://data36.com/python-import-built-in-modules-data-science/) in Python used for data formatting, analysis and manipulation. It helps you to deal with 2-D table-like data structures, which is what business people and other stakeholders are used to see.<br> \n",

To add the features of Pandas to Python, you need to install it by running `pip install pandas`. [Pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#use-pip-for-installing) is a package installer that is recommended to help you installing new libraries to your working environment.\n",
